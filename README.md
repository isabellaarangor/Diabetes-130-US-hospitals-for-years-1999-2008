Supervised learning project using data from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository para la predicci√≥n de early readmission of patients diagnosed with diabetes within 30 days of discharge.

The following test is designed to demonstrate your skills as a Data Scientist by showing how you solve a common Data Scientist task.
In this data set, you have 3 different results:
1. No readmission.
2. A readmission in less than 30 days (this situation is not good, as it could indicate that the treatment was not adequate).
3. A readmission in more than 30 days (this situation is also not desirable, although the reason could be the patient's condition).
Your task is to classify a patient's outcome in relation to the hospital, or to group them with the aim of

The proposed solution is a basic solution to the problem, so the results obtained do not present significant evaluation metrics. However, it turns out to be a basis for anyone who wants to continue with the solution of the challenge.
